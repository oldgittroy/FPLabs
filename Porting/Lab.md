**Porting OO Code to HOF**

1. State variables -> Immutable variables + Pure Functions
2. Classes and Methods -> Closures and Functions
3. Interfaces and Inheritance -> HoFs
4. Loops -> Catamorphisms and Recursion

---

**Advanced Lab**

1.  Exercise - turn a stateful class into an immutable one


[Immutable Variables in a Class](./Immutable.md)


2. Exercise - Turn the class into a closure


[Class to Closure](./Closures.md)

3.  Exercise - use composition over inheritance


[Use Composition](./Composition.md)

4.  Exercise - replace loops with catamorphisms


[Use Catamorphisms](./Catamorphisms.md)

5.  Now, find a class you have written, or download a project from github and port it to functional
