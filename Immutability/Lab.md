**Immutability Lab**

Expressions, not statements.  Math libraries are an example of things that should be pure functions.  1 + 1 better be 2.

**C# static methods**

1. Create a static class for math

```
public static class MyMath 
{
    
}

```
2. Create a static method
We are not worrying about generics yet.  Just go with it.

```
public static int Add(int val1, int val2) => 
{
    return val1 + val2;
}

```

3. Create a static method for adding strings

4. Write a unit test to show that 1 + 1 is 2

5.  Write a unit test for the string addition method


**F# functions**



**JS functions**
