![composition](../Images/composition.jpg)


* LINQ and C# Method chaining:  x.FirstOrDefault().ToList()

* C# Func<T> passing in interfaces:  <T> MyFunc(Func<T,U>) {}

* F# <.> operator

![inheritance](../Images/inheritance.jpg)

Containers that you put a value into and get a function out of it
Just like the instance of a class

Polymorphism = pass a function into the closure
Inheritance = pass a function into the closure
