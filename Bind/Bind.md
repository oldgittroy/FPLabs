**Bind**

Compose functions that cross multiple combinator libraries

![bind](../Images/bind.jpg)

A container produces a function, that a second container uses to move something into itself

---

In English:  bind allows you to take methods from one closure/class and use them on another closure/class as if they belonged there!


Or think of it as making a function that can be used on multiple classes or closures without being a part of the class/closure.
